## ChatFX  
  
JavaFX chat hooked up with Google Gemini flash 2.0 API  
it works but is still far from beautiful :D    
  
  
This branch is to be used with an already set environment-variable for GOOGLE_API_KEY.  
  
If you do not have an active API key for Google AI please sign up and get one from here. Also follow the 
instructions from the docs.
