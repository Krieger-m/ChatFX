## ChatFX

JavaFX chat hooked up with Google Gemini flash 2.0 API  
it works but is still far from beautiful :D


This branch is to be used with a hardcoded GOOGLE_API_KEY.  
It is set in the Server.java file on line 21  
  
please delete your own API key before sharing and uploading

If you do not have an active API key for Google AI please sign up and get one from here. Also follow the
instructions from the docs.
